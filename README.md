# Python vs Ruby vs JavaScript

## Division

**In Python**, we use true division.

```python
1 / 2 #=> 0.5
```

**In Ruby**, we use integer division.

```ruby
1 / 2 #=> 0
```

**In JavaScript**, we use true division.

```javascript
1 / 2; //=> 0.5
```

## Strings

### Slice

**In Python**, we use the `[]` function, passing in three params:

1. Start index
2. End index (which is _excluded_)
3. Stepper

```python
s = "abcdefghijk"
s[0:3]  # From index 0 to 3 (exclusive) => "abc"
s[:3]   # From the start to index 3 (exclusive) => "abc"
s[1:]   # From index 1 to the end => "bcdefghijk"
s[::2]  # From the start to the end in steps of 2 => "acegik"
```

**In Ruby**, we use the `slice` function, passing two params:

1. Start index
2. Number of chars you want to take

```ruby
s = "abcdefghijk"
s.slice(0,3)  # From 0, take the 3 first chars => "abc"
```

Alternatively, you can pass a range (considering the end index is _included_)

```ruby
s = "abcdefghijk"
s[0..3] # From index 0 to 3 (inclusive) => "abcd"
```

Or a regex, with an optional capture group

```ruby
s = "abcdefghijk"
s[/[aeiou]/]      #=> "a"
```

**In JavaScript**, we use the `slice` function, passing two params:

1. Start index
2. End index (which is _excluded_)

```ruby
s = "abcdefghijk"
s.slice(0,3) # From index 0 to 3 (exclusive) => "abc"
```

### Reverse

**In Python**

```python
s[::-1] # From the start to the end in steps of 1, counting backwards => "kjihgfedcba"
```

**In Ruby**

```ruby
s.reverse #=> "kjihgfedcba"
```

**In JavaScript**, there's no built-in function for this.

### Immutability

**In Python**, Strings are _immutable_.

```python
s = "Sun"
s[0] = "F" # => TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

**In Ruby**, Strings are mutable.

```ruby
s = "Sun"
s[0] = "F"
s #=> Fun
```

**In JavaScript**, Strings are _immutable_.

```javascript
let s2 = "Sun";
s2[0] = "F"; // The action is not performed but no error is triggered
console.log(s2[0]); // Sun
```

### Capitalization

**In Python**

```python
s.upper()
s.lower()
```

**In Ruby**

```ruby
s.upcase
s.downcase
```

**In JavaScript**

```javascript
s.toUpperCase();
s.toLowerCase();
```
